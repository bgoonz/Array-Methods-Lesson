### forEach() <a href="96f8" id="96f8"></a>

```
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4]array.forEach((elemnt, index) => {   console.log(`Element ${element} at index ${index}`)}
```

\*\*`forEach` \*\*method will call the function provided once for each element in the array preserving the order. This function provided can take in 3 different arguments: `element`, `index`, `array`. Be sure that the order in which you pass these parameters follow the order.





The [`for` loop](https://alligator.io/js/for-loops/) is probably one of the first looping mechanisms you learned about when diving into JavaScript.

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Result:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

The `for` loop above takes 3 statements within it:

1. `let i = 0`, which executes before the loop starts
2. `i < 5`, which is the condition for running the block of code within your loop
3. `i++`, which runs after each iteration of your loop

The result of those three statements is that the `for` loop executes the code within it, which is `console.log(i)`. Our `i` starts at 0, and as long as `i` is smaller than 5, weâ€™ll run the code block. However, after each loop, we add 1 to our `i`, as shown by the third statement, `i++`.

Letâ€™s dive into something a little fancier for this `for` loop. Letâ€™s assume that we have an array with some objects in it:

```
const foodArray = [
  { name: 'Burrito' },
  { name: 'Pizza' },
  { name: 'Burger' },
  { name: 'Pasta' }
];
```

Letâ€™s say we wanted to use a `for` loop to iterate over each object within the `foodArray`. We would alter the condition and use `i` as the numeric index to access the values within `foodArray`.

```
for (let i = 0; i < foodArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(`i value: ${i} | Food Name:`, foodArray[i]);
}

// Result:
// i value: 0 | Food Name: { name: 'Burrito' }
// i value: 1 | Food Name: { name: 'Pizza' }
// i value: 2 | Food Name: { name: 'Burger' }
// i value: 3 | Food Name: { name: 'Pasta' }
```

### What About forEach?

Like the `for` loop, the `forEach` method can also achieve the same results:

```
foodArray.forEach((food, index) => {
  console.log(`i value: ${index} | Food Name:`, food);
});

// Result:
// i value: 0 | Food Name: { name: 'Burrito' }
// i value: 1 | Food Name: { name: 'Pizza' }
// i value: 2 | Food Name: { name: 'Burger' }
// i value: 3 | Food Name: { name: 'Pasta' }
```

#### How is that possible? <a href="how-is-that-possible" id="how-is-that-possible"></a>

The `forEach` method exists within all arrays. In our case, `foodArray` is an array that inherits all of the various methods from `Array.prototype`. For the `forEach` method, we pass in a function that will be executed in each iteration.

### Which Should You Use?

It really comes down to the preference of the developer. However, here are some things to consider when choosing between a `for` loop and the `forEach` method.

#### 1. forEach keeps the variableâ€™s scope to the block <a href="1-foreach-keeps-the-variables-scope-to-the-block" id="1-foreach-keeps-the-variables-scope-to-the-block"></a>

The good thing about `forEach` is that the callback function within it allows you to keep that variable within the `forEach`â€™s scope. If youâ€™ve assigned a variable outside and re-use it within the `forEach`, the outside variable retains its value.

```
const num = 4;
const arr = [0, 1, 2];

arr.forEach(num => {
  console.log(num);
});

// Result:
// 0
// 1
// 2
console.log(num);

// Result:
// 4
```

Normally, you would try to avoid naming a variable twice like in the example above. It's just to make a point!

#### 2. Lower chance of accidental errors with forEach <a href="2-lower-chance-of-accidental-errors-with-foreach" id="2-lower-chance-of-accidental-errors-with-foreach"></a>

When using the `forEach` method, youâ€™re calling on the `Array.prototype` method in relation to the array directly. When you use a `for` loop, you have to set up a variable to increment (`i`), a condition to follow, and the actual increment itself.

Based on the example above, letâ€™s say that we wrote a `for` loop like this:

```
for (let i = 0; i <= foodArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(`i value: ${i} | Food Name:`, foodArray[i]);
}

// Result:
// i value: 0 | Food Name: { name: 'Burrito' }
// i value: 1 | Food Name: { name: 'Pizza' }
// i value: 2 | Food Name: { name: 'Burger' }
// i value: 3 | Food Name: { name: 'Pasta' }
// i value: 4 | Food Name: undefined
```

I changed my condition from `<` to a `<=`. Instead of ending at 3, which is less than the length of my array, it goes all the way to 4. Since thereâ€™s nothing in our array at index 4, it returns an undefined. This type of off-by-one-bug is a logic error when your iterative loop iterates one more or less than you anticipated.

Using a `forEach` loop, this can be avoided.

#### 3. forEach is easier to read <a href="3-foreach-is-easier-to-read" id="3-foreach-is-easier-to-read"></a>

Again, this is down to the discretion of the developer, but hereâ€™s why I feel that the `forEach` method is a little cleaner than the `for` loop.

In a `forEach` method, we pass each food type within that iteration into the callback. A `for` loop needs you to access the array using a temporary `i` variable. While this might not seem very messy in the beginning, it can get more cluttered when you begin to add more code.

```
for (let i = 0; i < foodArray.length; i++) {
  let food = foodArray[i];
  console.log(food);
  for (let j = 0; j < food.ingredients.length; j++) {
    let ingredient = food.ingredients[j];
    console.log(ingredient);
  }
}
```

Thereâ€™s a bit going on in the code above. Having to use the temporary `i` and `j` variables can add a lot of confusion to your code. Hereâ€™s what it would look like as a `forEach` instead:

```
foodArray.forEach((food) => {
  console.log(food);
  food.ingredients.forEach((ingredient) => {
    console.log(ingredient);
  });
});
```

Weâ€™ve gotten rid of the temporary counter variables and it requires fewer lines of code!

#### 4. You can break out of a for loop earlier <a href="4-you-can-break-out-of-a-for-loop-earlier" id="4-you-can-break-out-of-a-for-loop-earlier"></a>

One main reason why I would use the `for` loop is if I needed to break out of a loop early. If you wanted to only return a certain food in your array, you could use an `if` statement to check if your criteria matches, and then break out from the loop. The `forEach` method would iterate over each food, which could lead to performance issues.

Hereâ€™s an example of what the `for` loop would look like if you broke out of it early:

```
for (let i = 0; i < foodArray.length; i++) {
  if (foodArray[i].name === 'Pizza') {
    console.log('I LOVE PIZZA');
    break;
  }
}
```

When we use the `break` keyword, we can stop the loop from continuing once weâ€™ve found the condition we were looking for.
